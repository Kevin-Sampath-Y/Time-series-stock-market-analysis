Time series forecasting project comparing ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM models for stock price prediction using Python.

# üìà Stock Price Forecasting: LSTM vs ARIMA/SARIMA

This project compares traditional time series forecasting techniques (**ARIMA**, **SARIMA**) with a deep learning model (**LSTM**) to predict stock prices. The notebook is developed using Python and Jupyter and is part of my internship project at Zidio.

## üìå Project Objectives

- Collect and analyze historical stock data
- Understand and visualize trend, seasonality, and noise
- Apply and compare:
  - ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
  - LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory neural network)
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE
- Visualize predictions for each method

---

## üõ† Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Statsmodels (ARIMA, SARIMA)
- TensorFlow / Keras (LSTM)
- Scikit-learn (for preprocessing & evaluation)

## üìä Forecasting Models Used

### 1. **ARIMA**
- Captures autoregressive and moving average patterns
- Best for linear, stationary time series

### 2. **SARIMA**
- Extension of ARIMA for handling **seasonal** data
- Includes seasonal trend and cyclical effects

### 3. **LSTM**
- Recurrent Neural Network capable of learning long-term dependencies
- Effective for nonlinear and complex patterns

---

## üìà Evaluation Metric

- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)** is used to compare prediction accuracy between models.

---

## üß† Key Insights

- ARIMA/SARIMA perform well for simple and seasonal data
- LSTM may outperform traditional models when trends are nonlinear or noisy
- Model choice depends on data complexity, computational resources, and interpretability needs
